							From ancient times, Dokdo has historically and geographically been Korean territory. However, Japan has continually attempted to annex the islet through provocation. Japan has tried various means to convert Dokdo into a disputed territory. Recently, Japan has begun to teach materials related to Dokdo sovereignty as part of the Social Studies curriculum.<br/>
							Meanwhile, Korea has firmly believed in its sovereignty over Dokdo. To effectively counter Japan’s provocations, Korea must continue to respond in a meticulous manner. Koreans must be able to clearly explain, with accurate knowledge, that Dokdo is Korean territory not only to the people of Japan, but to the international community, as well.<br/>
							Thus, the Northeast Asian History Foundation has developed Dokdo Awareness for elementary school students, and follows that text with Dokdo: Korean Territory for junior high school students. This second textbook has been developed with junior high school students in mind, and its contents have been thoroughly verified.<br/></paragraph><paragraph align="left"><pTitle align="left" type="소제목">2. 『Dokdo: Korean Territory』 - Education Purpose</pTitle></paragraph><paragraph align="left">
							In order to end Japan’s provocations and publicize Korean sovereignty over Dokdo to Japan and the international community, Koreans must educate themselves with proper knowledge about Dokdo and its history. Only with the right set of tools will Koreans be able to convince others of the claim to sovereignty over Dokdo.<br/>
							The best place to accomplish this goal is in the schools. Education about Dokdo must be reinforced at the elementary, junior high, and high school levels. Proper education will allow students to explain geographical, historical, political, diplomatic, and international law issues with confidence.<br/>
							Koreans must take not an emotional response, but an objective and logical response. With the appropriate education, Koreans will be able to identify Japan’s claims regarding Dokdo and successfully refute such claims on a factual basis. <br/></paragraph><paragraph align="left">

							The contents of this textbook are linked with the elementary school and the high school editions. Geographical information is central to the elementary school edition, and historical information is the focal point of the junior high school edition. This textbook is divided into nine chapters, and the content of each chapter is implied in the humorous chapter titles.

							This textbook has been designed to explore the geographical and historical facts about Dokdo through critical thinking. Readers will gain the ability to explain the history of Dokdo on a factual basis to those unfamiliar with the subject. <br/>
							The content of each chapter is implied in the chapter titles. In addition, the chapter titles were created to be light and approachable for junior high students. Each chapter is focused on no more than two or three main ideas.<br/><emph align="left" type="bold">Critical Thinking</emph> was designed to encourage students’ independent analysis. <emph align="left" type="bold">Critical Thinking</emph> sections are closely related to the corresponding chapters, but direct Dokdo-related material has been avoided whenever possible. Furthermore, illustrations, photographs, comics, and maps maintain the approachability for students.<br/>
							The main body of this section also utilizes various types of visual aids to hold student interest and enhance effective learning. The material and activities presented within the main body encourage students to explore and learn on their own through discovery.<br/>
							Material that requires detailed analysis is denoted by a text box, and explanations for key terms are reiterated in text bubbles. To encourage additional independent study, parts of each chapter that are relevant and require further examination are presented to the student at the end of the chapter.<br/>
							The last part of each chapter consists of the core content summarized in an easy-to-read outline. The information is reiterated to enable the students to absorb the learned material.<br/></paragraph><paragraph align="left"><pTitle align="left" type="소제목">2 Textbook Utilization</pTitle></paragraph><paragraph align="left"><emph align="left" type="bold">A. Class length and level</emph><br/><emph align="left" type="italic">Dokdo: Korean Territory</emph>: This book was designed with nine class units. To fully utilize the 45 minutes of class time and cover all the content in each chapter, a dictionary is necessary. The teacher needs to actively pursue discovery learning so that students will take it upon themselves to study at home. Since each chapter consists of six pages, there may appear to be too much content to cover in one class unit. However, the textbook is focused on activities, and 45 minutes should be sufficient to complete one chapter.<br/>
							Dokdo education may be completed in place of Social Studies or creative activities. If the course is to be taught during Social Studies, it may be difficult to complete the entire nine-hour course within one allotted topic range of a school year. It may be best to divide the textbook by grade level or topic range and use it in conjunction with existing relevant class material. If Dokdo education is to take place during creative activities, weekly one-hour classes will allow the course to be completed in one half-semester.<br/>
							To maximize the effectiveness of this textbook, Dokdo education must be included in the annual lesson plan at the beginning of the school year. The optimal time to teach the course would be during the eighth or ninth grade Social Studies classes in the History topic area. Another time would be during seventh grade or ninth grade junior high school Social Studies in the Geography topic area.<br/>
							If Dokdo education cannot be taught during such times, having a separate class dedicated to the topic would be a suitable substitute. In this case, only a few integral chapters can be covered, or a new lesson plan may be implemented with material extracted from several areas of the textbook. Eighth or ninth grade students would be best suited for this type of supplemental education.<br/></paragraph><paragraph align="left"><emph align="left" type="bold">B. Chapter Utilization</emph><br/>
							Chapters 1 and 2 focus primarily on geographical information. This textbook was designed to maximize visual stimulation, and therefore a large number of visual aids were provided. Supplementing the course with various photos, illustrations, maps, and videos from the Internet will improve the effectiveness of this textbook.<br/>
							Chapters 3 through 8 treat Korean and Japanese historical documents, such as maps and other texts to demonstrate Korea’s sovereignty over Dokdo. Numerous maps and documents are presented in these chapters. Unfortunately, though, the images are small because of the limitations on the size and length of the textbook. High-quality versions of the textbook images may be found on the website and used as supplemental classroom material.<br/>
							Chapter 9 concentrates on refuting Japan’s claims on Dokdo. The Northeast Asian History Foundation has developed several effective materials to be used in conjunction with the textbook, and these may be found on the website. All of this information may be found in the Appendix, which has been designed for the educators in charge of teaching this course.<br/>
							There are many Dokdo-related organizations, and most have websites that supply useful materials. Taking full advantage of all the latest material and information found on the Northeast Asian History Foundation website is recommended (<link><url src="http://www.dokdohistory.com" target="blank" title="http://www.dokdohistory.com"/></link>). When using material provided by other organizations, verifying the source and reliability of such information is highly recommended.<br/></paragraph><paragraph align="left"><emph align="left" type="bold">C. Teachers – Teaching Methods</emph><br/>
							The primary goal of this textbook is to strengthen Korean sovereignty over Dokdo and refute Japan’s claims on the basis of factual evidence.<br/>
							To achieve this goal, the material presented in this textbook must be fully utilized, and the students must be encouraged to solve problems on their own through discovery learning. Through this method, the students will gain the ability to think critically and develop their natural curiosity.<br/>
							The following methods are recommended to effectively teach about Dokdo using <emph align="left" type="italic">Dokdo: Korean Territory</emph>.<br/>
							⑴ Students must achieve a clear understanding of the basic facts about Dokdo.<br/>
							A clear understanding of the basic facts is a crucial part of Dokdo education from elementary school through junior high school. A core basic knowledge must be built using the materials presented in this textbook. Only after achieving a full understanding of the Dokdo geography information learned in the elementary and junior high levels will students be able to process the historical information presented in the latter half of the book. A complete understanding is required in order to properly critique Japan’s claims of Dokdo.<br/>
							⑵ A variety of teaching methods are to be used.<br/>
							The contents of this textbook consist of three main parts: Geographical facts, historical facts, and rebuttals to Japan’s claims. The topics covered in each chapter are unique. Each chapter requires its own specific teaching method. When the materials covered during a one-hour lesson are varied, applying different teaching methods according to the lesson would be ideal. A wide range of teaching methods will engage the students’ interest in learning, and the effects of education can be maximized.<br/>
							⑶ Encourage students to explore on their own.<br/>
							This textbook is constructed in a way that discourages unilateral teaching and encourages discovery learning to fully engage the students with the material. For students to take full advantage of the education, the teacher must encourage them to explore. The teacher’s role is best utilized as a guide or helper.<br/>
							⑷ Content can be adjusted to the student level.<br/>
							The reality is that Dokdo education is not systematically taught in conjunction with standard education. Therefore, the contents of this book may be new to many students. The contents in this textbook may be difficult for students without any basic knowledge about Dokdo. In addition, because this book was created with the cognitive development of eighth and ninth grade students in mind, the course may be difficult for students outside of that age range. In these situations, the content of the textbook can be customized and reconfigured according to the needs of the student as long as the original content is not distorted or misrepresented.<br/>
							⑸ The focus is on generating interest in Dokdo rather than on gaining as much knowledge as possible.<br/>
							The acquisition of knowledge is a primary objective of the course. However, if students’ interest in Dokdo were to wane as a result of the education, the result would be worse than not learning about Dokdo at all. Thus, a greater emphasis should be placed upon a fun and interesting learning experience.<br/>
							⑹ Different levels of schools should accommodate a continuous, successive Dokdo education program.<br/></paragraph></content></commentary></description></front></level1>
